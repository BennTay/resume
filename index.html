            <p align="justify">
               I was stationed at <a href="https://www.se.com/">Schneider Electric's</a></aSchneider> <a href="https://www.se.com/sg/en/work/support/hub-asia/">HubAsia Distribution Centre</a>
               to help with improving the efficiency of warehouse processes. As the only software engineer onsite, I was given a number of projects which allowed me to learn
               fullstack software development skills (through developing apps from scratch). This involved UI design/programming and SQL database deployment/integration,
               both of which I had no prior experience with. However, I became comfortable with them after a month of simultaneous research and diving head first into the
               projects.<br>
               Listed below are some of the projects and responsiblities I picked up at Schneider Electric.

              <li><strong>Improving customer visibility in the self-collection process</strong></li>
              <details>
                <p align="justify">
                  <em><u>Background info</u></em><br>
                  One outbound process is called "Releasing", and it is simply when goods are released from the warehouse into the ownership of their respective customers (usually
                  through delivery). In some cases with smaller packages, customers can choose to personally visit Hub Asia and collect their items. These packages need to be prepared
                  (picked from storage and packed properly by Releasing personnel) before they can be released to customers for collection. Sometimes, customers may arrive before their
                  packages are ready for collection and therefore will need to wait. Once the package is ready, the customer can then collect it and leave Hub Asia.
                  <br>
                  <em><u>Problem</u></em><br>
                  Issues in customer dissatisfaction and time wastage rise during these instances where customers need to wait for their packages to be prepared. Customers can verbally
                  enquire the Releasing personnel present at the reception area about the status and time of completion for their packages. Sometimes, the information given may be slightly
                  inaccurate, leading customers to enquire repeatedly when their packages take longer than expected. This is where customer dissatisfaction rises as well as time wastage due
                  to the Releasing personnel needing to repeatedly check and verbally update customers.
                  <br>
                  <em><u>My solution</u></em><br>
                  I developed a multi-component application to provide a data-driven connection from the start to the end of the self-collection process. The app is deployed on 3 computers: 
                  (1) guardhouse check-in/check-out computer, (2) Releasing team computer, (3) reception area computer hooked up to a large television screen. Each area serves a different
                  purpose, and thus can only access its relevant components in the app. Customers arriving at Hub Asia will first check in at the guardhouse by submitting their information
                  through the check-in component of the app. Releasing personnel can then see the customer information on the app on their computer, and provide updates on package status and estimated completion time through
                  the info-update component interface. When Releasing personnel provide these updates, the information is immediately displayed on the reception area television through the dashboard page component
                  of the app. Customers waiting at the reception area can therefore refer to the live dashboard for instant updates on their package information. Once a customer's package is ready, they will be prompted
                  through the dashboard. Then, the customer can collect their package, check-out at the guardhouse, and leav Hub Asia.<br>

                  Ever since the implementation of the dashboard, surveys have found that customer satisfaction had increased. Releasing team personnel also found that they had more time to focus on other responsibilities
                  since they no longer needed to verbally update customers every now and then.

              <li><strong>Optimising the Put Away inspection process</strong></li>
              <details>
                <p align="justify">
                  <em><u>Background info</u></em><br>
                  One of the warehouse processes is "Put Away", where inbound delivered goods are received and need to be recorded before being kept away. Part
                  of this process involves scanning the barcodes on labels pasted on the packaging. This crosschecks with information in a database
                  to see if the labels are correct. There are 5 such stations, each with its own computer and barcode scanner.<br>
                  <em><u>Problem</u></em><br>
                  The problem with this was that the interface being used by operators for barcode scanning was a makeshift app using excel and VBA,
                  where one sheet acts as the main scanning page, another sheet contains the data for crosschecking, and another sheet records the
                  scans conducted by operators. This means each of the 5 station computers needs its own copy of the excel file, resulting in 5 duplicates
                  of the same crosschecking data, all of which need to be simultaneously updated whenever new data is available. Also, all the recorded data
                  of barcode scans conducted had to be pooled from the 5 separate excel files and compiled in order to display statistics in Tableau. Lastly,
                  excel files have a hard limit on the number of rows per sheet which limits the lifespan of this implementation.<br>
                  <em><u>My solution</u></em><br>
                  I extracted and migrated the reference data for label cross-checking into a proper MySQL database.
                  This way, all the scanning station computers could access the same centralized database for information.
                  All the data for each scan conducted is also stored into the same database, and pooling is no longer necessary as Tableau can connect directly
                  to the centralized database to generate live reports and statistics. Users' login credentials are also stored on the database instead of the previous
                  excel sheets, improving security.<br>
                  In order to interface with the database, I developed a desktop application to replace the Excel files. This app provided the same barcode scanning
                  functionality in addition to a few other requested features such as automatic updating of the crosscheck database, exporting scan records into an
                  excel file for CS&Q (Customer Satisfaction & Quality) personnel to check, as well as generic user management (adding & deleting of users) for admins.<br>
                  Ever since the implementation of the database and application, CS&Q personnel could save 1 hour every day since they no longer needed to manually collate
                  data from multiple Excel files. This translates to roughly $284 being saved monthly.

                  <em><u>Background info</u></em><br>
                  The thousands of barcode scans done during the put away process can result in varying statuses (CORRECT, INCORRECT, VISUAL CHECK). "INCORRECT" and
                  "VISUAL CHECK" statuses imply that some issue is present which needs to be fixed, with various possible root causes for these issues.<br>
                  <em><u>Problem</u></em><br>
                  In order to stay updated as well as investigate these issues effectively, CSQ and management personnel require daily reports on the scans conducted.
                  This includes a summary of the statuses encountered along with their root causes.<br>
                  <em><u>My solution</u></em><br>
                  I wrote a Python script which runs automatically every morning to send an e-mail to a list of mailees. This script connects to the database I created for the
                  Put Away Scanning app to retrieve the relevant data, generate graphics (pareto charts, pivot tables, simple HTML tables) to display the information, and
                  send the formatted e-mail to personnel.

              tremendously both as a programmer and as a person. Their well-structured internship programme, inviting culture, and willingness to place large responsibilities

          During my internship at Schneider Electric, I was in charge of designing and developing functional desktop applications to be used daily in live production environments.
          Since I was the only software engineer, I became intimately familiar with every facet of development from beginning till end. Some things I learnt include: UI design/programming
          (to create user-friendly interfaces), MySQL database creation and integration (for all the apps running on computers throughout the warehouse to simultaneously store and retrieve
          data), and defensive programming so as to minimize bugs in the app (which would be costly if encountered in production).<br>
          Of course, I have worked with teams as well on software engineering projects in NUS and am able to communicate/work effectively with other developers to achieve our goals.
          <!--I am familiar with software engineering design principles/patterns, practices (like quality assurance through unit testing) and paradigms
          (such as Scrum, sequential waterfall SDLC and iterative SDLC), having worked with a team on a >10,000 code base to produce a working and usable desktop application.-->

        <p>Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid skier and novice ice climber. During the warmer months here in Colorado, I enjoy mountain biking, free climbing, and kayaking.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the front-end web development world.</p>

        <p align="justify">Apart from programming, I am a self-taught ukulele fingerstylist. My interest in the instrument resulted in me coming across ukulele virtuosos such as Jake Shimabukuro and Kalei Gamiao, whose performances ignited my passion and inspired me to learn to play like them. To date, I have performed multiple times (sometimes with a band but mostly solos) for events such as concerts and competitions, and I have also conducted and introductory workshop for people wishing to pick up the ukulele.<br>
        I seek to continue performing in public as well as teaching more lessons. I have also uploaded some song covers to YouTube and strive to upload more in future.</p>
